# Fan Voting System - Future Implementation

## Overview

The Reeled AI platform will implement a revolutionary fan engagement system where viewers can influence the narrative direction of series through monetary voting. This system will allow fans to vote with their wallets on critical story decisions, creating a truly interactive and community-driven storytelling experience.

## System Architecture

### Voting Mechanics

**When Voting Occurs:**
- Voting is enabled ONLY at the end of each narrative arc (arc finales)
- Regular episodes within an arc remain under creative control
- Voting period opens after arc finale publication
- Voting window: 7 days from arc finale release

**What Fans Vote On:**
- Major story direction for the next arc
- Character fate decisions
- Significant plot developments
- New character introductions
- Location/setting changes

### Pay-to-Vote System

**Voting Currency:**
- Implement custom token system ("Story Tokens")
- 1 Vote = $1.00 USD minimum
- Allow multiple votes per user (weighted by payment)
- Higher payment = more voting power

**Payment Integration:**
- Stripe payment processing
- Support for credit cards, PayPal, crypto payments
- Instant vote registration upon payment confirmation
- Transparent voting tallies in real-time

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Voting Tables
CREATE TABLE voting_campaigns (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id),
  arc_number INTEGER,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  voting_options JSONB,
  start_date TIMESTAMP,
  end_date TIMESTAMP,
  status ENUM('pending', 'active', 'completed', 'cancelled'),
  total_votes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  total_revenue DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00
);

CREATE TABLE votes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  campaign_id UUID REFERENCES voting_campaigns(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  option_selected VARCHAR(255),
  vote_weight INTEGER,
  amount_paid DECIMAL(10,2),
  payment_id VARCHAR(255),
  voted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE vote_results (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  campaign_id UUID REFERENCES voting_campaigns(id),
  winning_option VARCHAR(255),
  total_participants INTEGER,
  total_revenue DECIMAL(10,2),
  finalized_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Endpoints

```typescript
// New API routes to implement
POST /api/voting/campaigns          // Create voting campaign
GET  /api/voting/campaigns/:id      // Get campaign details
POST /api/voting/campaigns/:id/vote // Submit vote with payment
GET  /api/voting/campaigns/:id/results // Get voting results
PUT  /api/voting/campaigns/:id/close   // Close voting campaign
```

### Frontend Components

```typescript
// New components to create
- VotingCampaignCard: Display active voting campaigns
- VoteSubmissionModal: Payment + vote selection interface
- VotingResults: Real-time results display
- VotingHistory: User's voting history
- PaymentForm: Secure payment processing
- VoteConfirmation: Vote confirmation and receipt
```

## Revenue Sharing Model

- 70% of voting revenue goes to series creators
- Distributed based on contribution:
  - Story Bible Creator: 40%
  - Episode Writers: 30%
  - Community Moderators: 30%

### Platform Revenue (30%)
- Platform maintenance and development
- Payment processing fees
- Marketing and promotion
