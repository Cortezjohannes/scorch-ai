ACTOR MATERIALS - ENHANCEMENTS COMPLETE ✅
========================================================

1. MASSIVELY IMPROVED RELATIONSHIP MAPS
   ✅ Power dynamics (who has power, how it shifts)
   ✅ Emotional dependencies (what each needs from other)
   ✅ Conflict patterns (source, triggers, how it manifests)
   ✅ Scene-by-scene evolution (temperature, status changes)
   ✅ History together (past events, unresolved issues, secrets)
   ✅ Actor notes (playable approach, what to avoid)
   ✅ Social circle mapping (inner/outer circles, adversaries)
   ✅ Loyalty map (who they'd betray or never betray)
   
   Result: Relationship maps went from basic to COMPREHENSIVE!

2. ENHANCED MATERIALS QUALITY
   ✅ Playable actions (specific verbs actors can use)
   ✅ Moment-to-moment beats (what changes each moment)
   ✅ Inner monologue (what they're thinking but not saying)
   ✅ Sensory work (what they see, hear, feel, smell)
   ✅ Psychological depth (needs, fears, wounds, defenses)
   ✅ Wants vs needs (surface vs deep motivations)
   ✅ Psychological gestures (physical embodiments)
   ✅ Animal work (physicality comparisons)
   ✅ Breath work (where they breathe from)
   ✅ Speech patterns (how voice changes with emotions)

3. REAL-TIME LOADING MODAL
   ✅ Shows current character being processed
   ✅ Displays specific phase (study guide, relationships, practice)
   ✅ Elapsed time counter (MM:SS)
   ✅ Smooth progress bar (0-100%)
   ✅ Recent updates feed (scrolling list of activities)
   ✅ Phase indicators (checkmarks for completed phases)
   ✅ Beautiful UI (purple/blue gradient with animations)
   ✅ Updates every 500ms for smooth experience

4. AI CALL EFFICIENCY
   ✅ 15 calls for 5 characters (3 per character)
   ✅ Still under 20 call limit!
   ✅ Each call generates substantial, vital materials
   ✅ No unnecessary calls added

GENERATION STRATEGY:
