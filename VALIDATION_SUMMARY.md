### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Issues Found**

#### üî¥ Critical: Story Bible Generation Timeout

**Issue:** Story bible generation takes >10 minutes and often times out

**Details:**
- API accepts requests correctly
- All 12 engines activate and begin processing
- Process exceeds reasonable timeout (600+ seconds vs expected 30-60s)
- Blocks testing of dependent features (episodes, pre-production)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- 12 comprehensive engines running with complex prompts
- Likely sequential execution instead of parallel
- Heavy Gemini API usage with large token counts
- No intermediate caching

**Impact:** HIGH
- Users will experience frustration
- May appear broken in production
- Limits practical usability

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. Implement parallel engine execution where possible
2. Add streaming/chunked responses
3. Implement caching for common patterns
4. Add timeout handling with partial results
5. Optimize engine prompts to reduce token usage
6. Consider breaking into smaller async jobs
