## 🔄 In Progress

### Dynamic Structure - Story Bible Generation
**Files to Update:**
- `/src/app/api/generate/story-bible/route.ts` (main entry point)
- `/src/services/fractal-narrative-engine-v2.ts` (if used)

**Changes Needed:**
1. Update Gemini fallback to use dynamic ranges (already partially done)
2. Ensure Azure OpenAI path also uses dynamic structure
3. Remove any remaining hard-coded limits

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

## ⏳ Pending

### 1. Engine Removal/Simplification (1-2 hours)

**Goal**: Remove 19-engine system, simplify to direct GPT-4.1 generation

**Files to Update:**
1. `/src/app/api/generate/episode/route.ts`
   - Remove engine-based paths
   - Keep only Director's Chair path (`episode-from-beats`)
   - Redirect old calls to new workflow

2. `/src/app/api/generate/episode-from-beats/route.ts`
   - Strengthen prompts to compensate for engine removal
   - Add comprehensive guidance that engines used to provide
   - Increase context and detail

3. Delete or deprecate engine files:
   - `/src/services/comprehensive-engines.ts`
   - `/src/services/engines-comprehensive.ts`
   - `/src/services/gemini-comprehensive-engines.ts`
   - Related engine implementation files

**Expected Benefits:**
- 8x faster generation (15s vs 120s)
- Simpler codebase (~5000 lines removed)
- More coherent output (no "telephone game")
- Easier to maintain and improve

### 2. Strengthen Episode-from-Beats Prompts (1 hour)

**Current Prompt** (already good):
```
You are a master screenwriter and auteur director...
- CINEMATIC STORYTELLING
- CHARACTER DEPTH
- FLEXIBLE STRUCTURE
- VIBE MASTERY
- DIRECTOR'S VISION
```

**Enhancements Needed:**
Add guidance that engines used to provide:
- Multi-layered conflict creation
- Character consistency across episodes
- Tension escalation patterns
- Dialogue authenticity techniques
- Genre-specific touches

**Approach**: Integrate engine wisdom into single comprehensive prompt

### 3. Update UI References (30 minutes)

**Files to Check:**
- `/src/components/EpisodeStudio.tsx` - Already using Director's Chair
- `/src/app/workspace/page.tsx` - Check for hard-coded episode counts
- Any UI displaying arc/episode counts

**Changes:**
- Remove references to "60 episodes"
- Make UI dynamic to handle variable structures
- Update copy to reflect flexible story lengths

### 4. Testing & Validation (1 hour)

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Generate story bible - verify dynamic structure
2. Generate episodes through Director's Chair
3. Compare quality to old engine-based system
4. Verify speed improvements
5. Test arc completion logic with variable arcs

## 📋 Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Complete Dynamic Structure (1 hour remaining)

```typescript
// src/app/api/generate/story-bible/route.ts

// UPDATE the main generation function to use dynamic structure:
async function generateStoryBibleWithAzure(synopsis: string, theme: string) {
  const prompt = `Create a comprehensive Story Bible with DYNAMIC structure:

Synopsis: ${synopsis}
Theme: ${theme}

DYNAMIC STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Determine optimal number of main characters (5-15 based on story needs)
- Determine optimal number of narrative arcs (2-10 based on story scope)
- Determine optimal episodes per arc (3-25 based on pacing needs)

Let the story determine its natural length - don't force fixed numbers.

[Rest of prompt...]
`
}
```

### Phase 2: Engine Removal (2 hours)

**Step 1**: Update episode generation route
```typescript
// src/app/api/generate/episode/route.ts

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.json()
  
  // REMOVED: Engine-based generation
  // REMOVED: 19-engine comprehensive system
  
  // NEW: Direct to Director's Chair workflow
  return NextResponse.json({
    message: 'Please use /api/generate/episode-from-beats for episode generation',
    redirectTo: '/episode-studio/${episodeNumber}'
  })
}
```

**Step 2**: Strengthen Director's Chair prompts
```typescript
// src/app/api/generate/episode-from-beats/route.ts

const enhancedSystemPrompt = `You are a master storyteller with expertise in:

NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE:
- Create multi-layered conflicts (internal vs external, character vs world)
- Ensure character consistency across episodes using context
- Build tension naturally through escalating stakes
- Structure scenes for maximum emotional impact

DIALOGUE & CHARACTER:
- Write authentic dialogue with subtext and character voice
- Show character psychology through action and speech patterns
- Develop relationships through natural interaction

WORLD & ATMOSPHERE:
- Create immersive sensory details
- Make the world feel alive and reactive
- Integrate theme through environment

GENRE MASTERY:
- Apply genre conventions authentically
- Balance formula and innovation
- Meet audience expectations while surprising them

Create engaging narrative prose that reads like a great novel.`
```

**Step 3**: Remove engine files (optional - can keep for reference)

### Phase 3: Testing (1 hour)

**Automated Tests:**
```bash
# Test dynamic structure
npm run test:story-structure

# Test episode generation speed
npm run test:generation-speed

# Test quality comparison
npm run test:quality-check
```

**Manual Tests:**
1. Create 3 different story bibles (simple, medium, complex)
2. Verify each gets appropriate structure
3. Generate episodes through Director's Chair
4. Compare to old system quality
5. Measure generation times

## 📝 Notes

### About the Inspirations Feature
The "💡 Inspirations" button in Episode Studio is already working great! It:
- Shows previous episode's branching options
- Helps overcome writer's block
- Located prominently in the UI
- Only shows when relevant (Episode > 1)

No changes needed here - it's perfect as-is!

### About GPT-4.1 Choice
Good choice! GPT-4.1 provides:
- Consistent quality
- Better instruction following
- Good at structured output
- Proven reliability
- Fast generation times

### About Engine System
The analysis suggests engines add complexity without proportional benefit for modern GPT-4.1. The Director's Chair workflow (beat sheets + vibe settings + notes) provides better creative control than automated analyzers.
