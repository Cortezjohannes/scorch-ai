# üõ†Ô∏è Script Engine Integration Fix

## Issue Summary

The script generation component was not properly using the AI engine enhancement despite:
1. Engine options being passed correctly from the API route
2. `DialogueEngineV2` implementation existing and working
3. Other components (Storyboard, Props, etc.) correctly using their respective engines

## Root Cause

The issue was identified in the engine activation condition within `generateV2Scripts` function:

```typescript
// Original problematic code
const useEngines = (options.useEngines || context.useEngines) && context.useEngines;
```

This condition was too restrictive and was incorrectly requiring `context.useEngines` to be true twice:
1. In the first part: `(options.useEngines || context.useEngines)`
2. And then again with: `&& context.useEngines`

This meant that even when `options.useEngines` was `true` from the API route, the engine would not activate unless `context.useEngines` was also set to `true`.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed the Engine Activation Condition

```typescript
// Fixed code
const useEngines = options.useEngines || context.useEngines;
```

This simplified condition now correctly activates the engine if either the options passed from the API route or the context specifies to use engines.

### 2. Added Engine Metadata to Return Value

```typescript
return {
  episodes,
  totalScenes: processedScenes,
  format: 'scene-by-scene-screenplay',
  engineEnhanced: useEngines
};
```

Added the `engineEnhanced` flag to the return value to properly indicate that the engine was used.

### 3. Enhanced the Script Scene Generation

```typescript
// For standard generation
return { 
  screenplay: result, 
  enhancedContent: false,
  metadata: null 
};

// For engine-enhanced generation
return {
  screenplay: enhancedContent,
  enhancedContent: true,
  metadata: {
    engineUsed: 'DialogueEngineV2',
    masterTechnique: options.masterTechnique || 'mixed',
    subtextLevel: options.subtextLevel || 'moderate',
    engineLevel: options.engineLevel || 'professional'
  }
};
```

Updated both the standard and enhanced generation paths to return proper metadata.

### 4. Captured Engine Metadata in Scene Objects

```typescript
scriptScenes.push({
  sceneNumber: j + 1,
  screenplay: sceneScript?.screenplay || "Scene script generation failed",
  // Store metadata for engine-enhanced content if available
  scriptMetadata: sceneScript?.metadata || null,
  engineEnhanced: sceneScript?.enhancedContent || false
});
```

Updated the scene objects to capture and propagate the engine metadata.

## Verification

The fix was verified by:

1. Running an A/B test that confirmed all 7 components now show "ENGINE ENHANCED" when engines are enabled
2. Manually testing with a simple 2-scene episode
3. Checking server logs to confirm engines are being called
4. Verifying the `engineEnhanced` flag is properly set in responses
5. Updating documentation to reflect the fixed status

## Documentation Updated

The following documentation has been updated:
- ENGINE_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md - Updated script engine status to "WORKING"
- ENGINE_AB_TESTING_RESULTS.md - Updated results to show 7/7 components working

## Conclusion

The engine integration is now fully functional across all 7 pre-production components. All engines are being properly activated when requested, and the system is ready for production deployment.
