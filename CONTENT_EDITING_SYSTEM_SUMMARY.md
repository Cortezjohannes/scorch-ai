# 🎬 AI-Powered Content Editing System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

I've created a complete content editing system that integrates seamlessly with your existing AI storytelling workflow while maintaining proper constraints and data integrity.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components Created:

1. **`EditingService`** (`src/services/editing-service.ts`)
   - Central service managing all editing operations
   - Constraint validation and permission checking
   - Edit history tracking and real-time notifications
   - Intelligent regeneration triggering

2. **`EditableStoryBible`** (`src/components/EditableStoryBible.tsx`)
   - Full story bible editing with constraint awareness
   - Character addition always available
   - Real-time permission validation
   - Inline editing with save/cancel functionality

3. **`EditableEpisode`** (`src/components/EditableEpisode.tsx`)
   - Scene-level editing with G.O.D.D. framework support
   - Auto-regeneration of subsequent scenes after edits
   - Visual feedback for regeneration status
   - Constraint-based editing locks

4. **`EditableScript`** (`src/components/EditableScript.tsx`)
   - Professional screenplay element editing
   - Add/delete script elements (action, dialogue, character, etc.)
   - Always editable pre-production scripts
   - Real-time formatting and validation

5. **`ContentEditor`** (`src/components/ContentEditor.tsx`)
   - Main integration component with tabbed interface
   - Edit history display and management
   - Real-time status updates
   - Seamless integration with existing UI

### API Endpoints Created:

1. **`/api/save-story-bible`** - Persists story bible changes
2. **`/api/save-episode`** - Persists episode scene edits
3. **`/api/save-script`** - Persists script element changes
4. **`/api/regenerate-scenes`** - AI-powered scene regeneration after edits

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Story Bible Editing Constraints
- **Full editing** when no episodes exist
- **Character addition only** after episodes are generated
- **Real-time validation** of editing permissions
- **Visual indicators** showing edit status and constraints

### ✅ Episode Scene Editing with Regeneration
- **Scene editing** until next episode is generated
- **Automatic regeneration** of subsequent scenes using AI
- **G.O.D.D. framework** support (Goal, Obstacle, Dilemma, Decision)
- **Visual feedback** during regeneration process

### ✅ Pre-Production Script Editing
- **Always editable** screenplay format
- **Element-level editing** with proper screenplay structure
- **Add/delete elements** with contextual menus
- **Professional formatting** maintained throughout

### ✅ Advanced Features
- **Edit history tracking** with timestamps and details
- **Real-time notifications** for collaborative editing
- **Intelligent constraints** based on workflow state
- **AI-powered regeneration** maintaining narrative coherence

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Integration

1. **Import the main component:**
```tsx
import ContentEditor from '@/components/ContentEditor'
```

2. **Add to your existing page:**
```tsx
<ContentEditor
  storyBible={storyBible}
  episodes={episodes}
  preProductionContent={preProductionContent}
  onStoryBibleUpdate={handleStoryBibleUpdate}
  onEpisodeUpdate={handleEpisodeUpdate}
  onScriptUpdate={handleScriptUpdate}
/>
```

### Constraint Logic

The system automatically enforces your requirements:

- **Story Bible:** Editable → Generate Episodes → Lock content (characters still addable)
- **Episodes:** Scenes editable → Generate Next Episode → Lock scenes
- **Scripts:** Always editable in pre-production

### AI Regeneration

When you edit a scene, the system:
1. Validates editing permissions
2. Saves the edit
3. Calls AI to regenerate subsequent scenes
4. Updates the episode with improved narrative flow

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Persistence Layer
The API endpoints are designed to integrate with your existing data storage:
- Firebase integration points provided
- Local storage fallbacks for development
- Extensible for any persistence mechanism

### AI Services  
Regeneration uses your existing AI infrastructure:
- Integrates with Azure OpenAI service
- Uses same model configuration
- Maintains narrative consistency

### UI Integration
Components are designed to work with your existing design system:
- Uses your UI components (Card, Button, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Consistent with your brand
