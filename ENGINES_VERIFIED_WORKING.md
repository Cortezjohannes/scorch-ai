## üé≠ **REAL CONTENT GENERATED BY YOUR ENGINES**

### **1. Professional Dialogue (Azure OpenAI - Sorkin Style)**
```
JORDAN
So, what's the verdict? You're officially one of those people who says "I love this place but‚Äî"?

ALEX
It's not a "but." I love this place. Period. Full stop. No "but." Just‚Ä¶ an ellipsis.

JORDAN
Ellipsis is code for "I'm leaving." You know that, right? It's passive-aggressive punctuation.

ALEX
I haven't said yes. I haven't said anything. I just‚ÄîI got the offer.

JORDAN
The offer. Capital O. Like something out of "The Godfather." You want me to talk you out of it or cheer you on?

ALEX
I want you to say you hate the idea. That it's selfish and I'll regret it and you'll never forgive me.

JORDAN
Oh, good. So, you want honesty and emotional blackmail all in one latte.
```
