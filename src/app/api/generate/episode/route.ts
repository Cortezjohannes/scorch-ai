CRITICAL EPISODE REQUIREMENTS:
- Third-person narrative prose (not script format)
- No screenplay formatting ("INT."/"EXT.", caps names, etc.)
- Dialogue should appear naturally within prose
- Hard 5-minute runtime target

SCENE POLICY (DYNAMIC 1–5):
- Prefer 1–3 fully fleshed scenes that carry the episode
- Use 4–5 scenes only if absolutely necessary to serve the story
- Scale scene depth by count:
  * Fewer scenes → longer, richer, deeper scenes
  * More scenes → shorter, tighter scenes with clear purpose

CRITICAL CHOICE REQUIREMENTS:
The branching options MUST be:
1. DIRECTLY emerge from the final scene's specific events, dialogue, conflicts, or revelations
2. Reference EXACT character names, relationships, objects, locations, or information from THIS episode
3. Allow ANY character (not just the protagonist) to take decisive action based on episode events
4. Present genuine moral dilemmas, strategic decisions, or relationship choices from the episode
5. Create consequences that will fundamentally alter the next episode's story direction
6. NEVER use generic templates - each choice must be unique to this episode's specific content
7. Focus on pivotal moments: betrayals, discoveries, confrontations, alliances, secrets revealed, etc.
8. EXACTLY 3 choices total - no more, no less
9. Mark EXACTLY ONE choice as "isCanonical: true" - the choice that best aligns with the story bible's premise, themes, and character arcs

CRITICAL EPISODE REQUIREMENTS:
- Third-person narrative prose (not script format)
- No screenplay formatting ("INT."/"EXT.", caps names, etc.)
- Dialogue should appear naturally within prose
- Hard 5-minute runtime target
- Use engine notes as optional guidance, but maintain your creative vision

SCENE POLICY (DYNAMIC 1–5):
- Prefer 1–3 fully fleshed scenes that carry the episode
- Use 4–5 scenes only if absolutely necessary to serve the story
- Scale scene depth by count:
  * Fewer scenes → longer, richer, deeper scenes
  * More scenes → shorter, tighter scenes with clear purpose
- Engine notes may suggest dialogue or tension improvements - incorporate naturally

CRITICAL CHOICE REQUIREMENTS:
The branching options MUST be:
1. DIRECTLY emerge from the final scene's specific events, dialogue, conflicts, or revelations
2. Reference EXACT character names, relationships, objects, locations, or information from THIS episode
3. Allow ANY character (not just the protagonist) to take decisive action based on episode events
4. Present genuine moral dilemmas, strategic decisions, or relationship choices from the episode
5. Create consequences that will fundamentally alter the next episode's story direction
6. NEVER use generic templates - each choice must be unique to this episode's specific content
7. Focus on pivotal moments: betrayals, discoveries, confrontations, alliances, secrets revealed, etc.
8. EXACTLY 3 choices total - no more, no less
9. Mark EXACTLY ONE choice as "isCanonical: true" - the choice that best aligns with the story bible's premise, themes, and character arcs
