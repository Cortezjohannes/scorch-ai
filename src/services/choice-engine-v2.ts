Based on the Choice Engine research, provide a comprehensive choice recommendation that includes:

1. THEORETICAL CORE - STRUCTURES OF AGENCY:
   - Narrative architecture taxonomy (Linear, Foldback, Branching Tree, QBN, Salience-Based)
   - Narrative paradox management (Authorial Intent vs Player Freedom)
   - Weight and consequence distribution strategies
   - Agency-coherence balance optimization

2. PSYCHOLOGY OF PLAYER CHOICE:
   - Meaningful vs false choice frameworks
   - Cognitive and emotional drivers (Loss Aversion, Choice Overload, Time Pressure)
   - Narrative satisfaction across multiple endings
   - Perception of impact optimization

3. ARCHITECTURAL BLUEPRINT:
   - Decision tree architecture and complexity management
   - Strategic pacing and placement of choices
   - Character development through choice (Defining vs Expressing)
   - Ludonarrative harmony techniques

4. ADVANCED CHOICE SYSTEMS:
   - Moral dilemma frameworks (Binary vs Systemic)
   - Resource-based narrative integration
   - Systemic culmination techniques (Mass Effect 2 Suicide Mission model)
   - Emergent choice consequence systems

5. EXPANDED INTERACTIVITY:
   - Second screen and multi-platform integration
   - Social media and community decision-making
   - AI-driven drama management and content generation
   - Cross-platform choice tracking and continuity

6. USER-CENTRIC INTERFACE:
   - UI/UX best practices for choice presentation
   - Cognitive overhead and decision fatigue management
   - Accessibility frameworks (Motor, Cognitive, Visual, Auditory)
   - Cultural adaptation and age-appropriate design

7. STRATEGIC GUIDANCE:
   - Implementation priorities and techniques
   - Psychology optimization methods
   - Platform integration strategies
   - Quality assurance frameworks

Provide detailed, actionable recommendations that balance meaningful player agency with narrative coherence, ensuring choices feel impactful while maintaining production feasibility and accessibility.`;
