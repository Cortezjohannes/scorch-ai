## 🐛 Known Issues to Address

### Minor Issues
1. **Linting Errors**: 3 errors in `fractal-narrative-engine.ts`
   - Type mismatches in dead code
   - Low priority (doesn't affect functionality)

2. **Master-Conductor Dead Code**: Lines 252-308
   - Old character generation code not being used
   - Could be removed for cleaner codebase

3. **Regeneration Count**: Stored in localStorage
   - Could be easily reset by clearing localStorage
   - Consider server-side tracking if cost is a concern

### Edge Cases to Test
1. What happens if user deletes all but one character?
   - Should prevent deletion of last character ✅ (already implemented)

2. What happens if user adds 100+ characters?
   - May need pagination or performance optimization

3. What happens if localStorage is full?
   - Should show error message

## 📊 Metrics to Track

### User Engagement
- How many characters do users add on average?
- How many do they delete?
- How many fields do they edit?
- Do they use regeneration or editing more?

### System Performance
- Story bible generation time (currently ~15 minutes)
- Character generation time per character
- Episode generation time
- localStorage usage

### Quality Metrics
- User satisfaction with AI-generated characters
