# Azure OpenAI Integration Fix

## Problem Identified

1. Your environment variables in `.env.local` use the names `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`.
2. The script `list-azure-deployments.js` was looking for `AZURE_API_KEY` and `AZURE_ENDPOINT`.
3. Environment variables weren't being properly loaded when running scripts directly with Node.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed environment variable names**: Updated `list-azure-deployments.js` to use the same environment variable names as in your `.env.local` file.

2. **Added proper environment file loading**: Updated scripts to correctly load variables from `.env.local`.

3. **Added DALL-E testing**: Confirmed that your DALL-E integration works correctly with the `dall-e-3` deployment.

4. **Identified chat model deployment issue**: Determined that you need to create deployments for the chat models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.) in the Azure portal.

5. **Created documentation**:

## How to Run Tests

For consistent results, source your environment variables before running the scripts:

```bash
source .env.local && node test-azure.js
```

or:

```bash
source .env.local && node list-azure-deployments.js
```

## Next Steps

1. Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to your Azure OpenAI resource
3. Create deployments for the chat models you want to use (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, etc.)
4. Update your `.env.local` file with the deployment names
5. Run the tests again to confirm everything is working
