# Gemini Fallback Update

## Overview

This update improves the model fallback mechanism to ensure that when `gemini-2.5-pro` fails, the system automatically falls back to `gemini-2.0-flash` before giving up, even when in "Gemini Only" mode.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Model Fallback Utility**
   - Modified `src/services/model-fallback-utils.ts` to add a special fallback path for Gemini models
   - When `useGeminiOnly` is true and the primary Gemini model fails, the system now attempts to use `gemini-2.0-flash` before giving up
   - This applies to both the `generateContentWithFallback` and `retryWithModelFallback` functions

2. **Updated Model Configuration**
   - Changed `PRO_FALLBACK` in `GEMINI_CONFIG.MODELS` from `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` to `gemini-2.0-flash`
   - Updated the `GEMINI_FALLBACKS` array to prioritize `gemini-2.0-flash` as the secondary fallback option

## How It Works

1. When a content generation request is made with `gemini-2.5-pro` and fails:
   - If `useGeminiOnly` is true (which is the default), the system now tries `gemini-2.0-flash` instead of immediately failing
   - This provides a more robust fallback mechanism while still staying within the Gemini model family

2. The fallback chain is now:
   - Primary: `gemini-2.5-pro` (best creative thinking)
   - Secondary: `gemini-2.0-flash` (reliable fallback)
   - Tertiary: `gemini-2.5-flash` (faster alternative)

## Testing

To test this functionality:
1. Make a request using `gemini-2.5-pro` that is likely to fail (e.g., with invalid parameters)
2. Observe in the logs that the system automatically attempts to use `gemini-2.0-flash`
3. Verify that the content is successfully generated using the fallback model

## Logs to Expect

When the primary model fails and fallback succeeds:
```
üöÄ Attempting content generation with primary model (gemini)...
‚ö†Ô∏è Primary model (gemini) generation failed: [Error details]
üîÑ Primary Gemini model failed, trying gemini-2.0-flash...
‚úÖ Fallback to gemini-2.0-flash successful
```

When all models fail:
```
üöÄ Attempting content generation with primary model (gemini)...
‚ö†Ô∏è Primary model (gemini) generation failed: [Error details]
üîÑ Primary Gemini model failed, trying gemini-2.0-flash...
‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback to gemini-2.0-flash failed: [Error details]
‚ùå All Gemini models failed and useGeminiOnly is set to true
```
