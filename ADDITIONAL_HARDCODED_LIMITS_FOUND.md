# üîç Additional Hardcoded Limits Found & Fixed

## Second Pass: Checking Other Engines

You asked to "check the other engines as well" - **good instinct!** Found 2 more hidden constraints.

---

## Additional Constraint #1: Arc/Episode Limits in Master Conductor ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Location**: `src/services/master-conductor.ts:129-130`

### BEFORE (Constrained)
```typescript
Based on this story's complexity, scope, and narrative needs, determine:
1. How many narrative arcs does this story need? (minimum 2, maximum 10)
2. How many episodes should each arc contain? (minimum 3, maximum 25 per arc)

Return ONLY a JSON array of arcs with this structure:
[
  {
    "title": "Arc Title",
    "summary": "What happens in this arc",
    "episodeCount": <number between 3-25>
  }
]
```

**Problem**: 
- Arcs constrained to 2-10 range
- Episodes per arc constrained to 3-25 range
- Epic sagas couldn't have 12+ arcs
- Short arcs couldn't have just 2 episodes

### AFTER (Free)
```typescript
Based PURELY on this story's complexity, scope, and narrative needs, determine:
1. How many narrative arcs does this story need?
2. How many episodes should each arc contain?

CRITICAL: Let story needs determine structure, not arbitrary limits.

Consider:
- Story scope and world complexity
- Number of character arcs that need development
- Thematic depth requiring exploration
- Genre conventions and pacing needs
- Natural dramatic structure

Examples:
- Simple story (few characters, single plot): 2-3 arcs, 4-6 episodes each
- Standard story (medium complexity): 3-5 arcs, 8-12 episodes each
- Complex story (many characters, subplots): 5-8 arcs, 10-20 episodes each
- Epic saga (massive scale): 8-12 arcs, 15-30 episodes each

Return ONLY a JSON array of arcs with this structure:
[
  {
    "title": "Arc Title",
    "summary": "What happens in this arc",
    "episodeCount": <number that fits THIS arc's needs>
  }
]

Make the structure organic to THIS specific story. Don't force generic numbers.
```

**Impact**: HIGH
- Epic sagas can now have 12+ arcs
- Short arcs can have 2 episodes
- Story dictates structure, not hardcoded limits

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

## Additional Constraint #2: Minimum 5 Locations ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Location**: `src/services/engine-mappers.ts:282`

### BEFORE (Constrained)
```typescript
function estimateLocationCount(episodes: Episode[]): number {
  const uniqueLocations = new Set(
    episodes.map(ep => ep.setting).filter(Boolean)
  );
  return Math.max(uniqueLocations.size, 5); // Minimum 5 locations
}
```

**Problem**:
- Even single-location stories forced to have 5 locations
- Intimate chamber piece? Forced to have 5 locations!
- "Buried" (movie in a coffin)? Would need 5 locations!

### AFTER (Free)
```typescript
function estimateLocationCount(episodes: Episode[]): number {
  const uniqueLocations = new Set(
    episodes.map(ep => ep.setting).filter(Boolean)
  );
  // Return actual count - some intimate stories may need fewer than 5 locations
  return Math.max(uniqueLocations.size, 1); // At least 1 location
}
```

**Impact**: MEDIUM
- Single-location stories now possible
- Two-location stories (home + work) possible
- Respects actual story needs

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

## What These Mean for Different Story Types

### Single-Location Intimate Drama
**Example**: "Two people trapped in an elevator confront their past"

**Before**:
- 12-18 characters (who's in the elevator?!)
- 5 locations (it's an elevator!)
- 2-10 arcs (for a simple story!)

**After**:
- 2-3 characters (perfect!)
- 1 location (the elevator)
- 2-3 arcs (setup, confrontation, resolution)

**Improvement**: Story actually makes sense now! ‚úÖ

---

### Epic Multi-Season Saga
**Example**: "10,000-year history of a galactic empire across 5 major wars"

**Before**:
- 18 characters max (can't show empire scale!)
- 10 arcs max (only 2 per war?!)
- 25 episodes per arc max (not enough!)

**After**:
- 40+ characters (emperors, generals, heroes across centuries)
- 15+ arcs (3 per major war, plus transitional arcs)
- 30+ episodes per arc (proper depth)

**Improvement**: Can actually tell an epic story! ‚úÖ

## Other Constraints We Chose to Keep

These are **reasonable defaults**, not arbitrary limits:

### 1. Quality Thresholds
```typescript
minimumQualityThreshold: 0.7
minimumEngineSuccessRate: 0.8
```
**Why Keep**: Quality control is good! These prevent garbage output.

### 2. Macro Structure Threshold
```typescript
if (episodeCount >= 15) return 'five-act';
```
**Why Keep**: Reasonable narrative structure heuristic.

### 3. Image Generation Limits
```typescript
if (images > 10) throw new Error('Must be between 1 and 10');
```
**Why Keep**: API limitation from DALL-E, not our choice.

### 4. Font Size Recommendations
```typescript
"Minimum 16px font, high contrast"
```
**Why Keep**: Accessibility guideline, not a constraint.
