## 💾 Data Backup Strategy

### Why Export/Import Matters

**localStorage Risks**:
- Browser cache clear → data lost
- Different device → can't access
- Browser crash → potential loss

**With Export/Import**:
- ✅ Backup to external file
- ✅ Move between devices
- ✅ Share with collaborators
- ✅ Version control (save multiple versions)
- ✅ Peace of mind

### Recommended Workflow

1. **After Generating Story Bible**:
   - Immediately export as backup

2. **After Major Edits**:
   - Export again
   - Keep multiple versions

3. **Before Regenerating**:
   - Export current version
   - Can always go back if you don't like the new one

4. **Working on Multiple Stories**:
   - Export each story
   - Import whichever you want to work on

├─ Arc 3: 12 episodes (fixed)
└─ Arc 4: 12 episodes (fixed)
Total: 48 episodes (no control)
```

### After (Flexible)
```
Any number of arcs
├─ Arc 1: 6 episodes (prologue)
├─ Arc 2: 15 episodes (rising action)
├─ Arc 3: 8 episodes (climax)
├─ Arc 4: 20 episodes (resolution)

## 🎓 User Guide Summary

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Episode Numbering**: When you add/delete episodes, numbers don't automatically renumber. This is by design (keeps episode IDs stable).

2. **Arc Reordering**: Can't drag-and-drop arcs yet. Would be a nice Phase 4 feature.

3. **Bulk Operations**: Can't select multiple items to delete at once. Could add in future.

4. **PDF Export**: Not implemented (marked as optional). JSON export covers backup needs.
